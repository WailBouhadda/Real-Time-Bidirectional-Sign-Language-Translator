# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Translator


The Real-Time Sign Language Translator project is an innovative application developed using TensorFlow and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This project leverages computer vision techniques, including MediaPipe and OpenCV, to detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. By combining cutting-edge technology with Python programming. This project aims to bridge communication gaps between the hearing-impaired community and the general public.
